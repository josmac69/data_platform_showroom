# Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora is a cloud-based relational database management system (RDBMS) that offers compatibility for both MySQL and PostgreSQL [2]. It is designed to provide high performance, availability, and security at one-tenth the cost of traditional commercial databases [2]. Some of the key features of Amazon Aurora include built-in security, serverless computing, multi-region replication, and support for other AWS services [2].

Use cases for Amazon Aurora include running enterprise applications, building Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, deploying globally distributed applications, and going serverless [2]. Its distributed, fault-tolerant, and self-healing storage system auto-scales up to 128 TiB per database instance, ensuring high performance and availability [3]. Additionally, Aurora provides up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones [3].

In comparison to other databases, Amazon Aurora is a part of Amazon RDS, a managed database service, but it offers better performance and scalability than traditional RDS solutions [3]. While it maintains compatibility with MySQL and PostgreSQL, it has been specifically designed for the cloud, giving it an edge over these traditional databases [2].

To get started with Amazon Aurora, users can sign in to the AWS Management Console, select RDS under the Database category, and choose Amazon Aurora as the database engine [3]. Both Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL are supported, allowing for easy migration of databases to and from Aurora [3]. Pricing for Amazon Aurora depends on the chosen option and capacity consumed, and it replicates each chunk of a database volume six ways across three Availability Zones without additional cost [3].
