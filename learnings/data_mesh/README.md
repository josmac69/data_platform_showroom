# Data Mesh

Data Mesh is an innovative approach to data platform architecture that focuses on scaling data in a decentralized manner. It was first introduced by Zhamak Dehghani, a thought leader in the field of data engineering and architecture. The main principles of Data Mesh are:

1. Domain-oriented ownership: Instead of having a centralized data team responsible for all data-related tasks, Data Mesh encourages organizations to distribute data ownership across multiple domain teams. Each team owns and operates its own data products, ensuring that data management is aligned with specific domain expertise.

2. Data as a product: Data Mesh treats data as a product, focusing on delivering high-quality, discoverable, and accessible data to users. This encourages teams to prioritize data usability and establishes a clear set of expectations around data quality and availability.

3. Self-serve data infrastructure: Data Mesh aims to provide a self-serve platform for data users, enabling them to discover, access, and use data independently. This reduces the need for centralized data teams to manage every aspect of data usage and accelerates data-driven decision-making across the organization.

4. Federated computational governance: Data Mesh promotes a federated governance model that enables domain teams to set their own policies, standards, and practices for data management, while still adhering to organizational guidelines and regulations.

Examples and use cases:

1. A large e-commerce company could implement a Data Mesh architecture by dividing its data domain into smaller units, such as customer data, product data, and order data. Each domain team would be responsible for maintaining and improving the quality of its respective data products.

2. A healthcare organization could apply Data Mesh principles to improve data interoperability and collaboration between different departments, such as patient care, billing, and research. By treating data as a product, the organization would enable seamless data sharing and collaboration across various teams.
