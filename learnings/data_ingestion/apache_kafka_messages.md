# Apache Kafka messages

ChatGPT4:

In Apache Kafka, messages (also called records) are the fundamental units of data that are produced, stored, and consumed. Here are the details about messages in Kafka:

**Data Format**: Kafka messages are essentially key-value pairs, where both key and value are byte arrays. This means that Kafka does not impose any specific data format or serialization mechanism. You can use any serialization format like JSON, Avro, Protocol Buffers, or even plain text, depending on your use case and requirements.

**Message Size**: Kafka's default maximum message size is 1 MB (including both key and value), but this can be configured by adjusting the max.message.bytes broker configuration and the max.request.size producer configuration. Increasing the message size may have implications on throughput, latency, and memory usage, so it should be carefully considered based on your specific use case and performance requirements.

**Message Storage**: Kafka stores messages in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner across the brokers in the cluster. Messages are organized into topics, which are divided into partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages. Partitions are replicated across multiple brokers to ensure fault tolerance and high availability. Messages within a partition are assigned a unique, monotonically increasing offset that consumers use to track their position in the partition.

**Message Retention**: Kafka retains messages for a configurable period, specified by the log.retention.hours, log.retention.minutes, or log.retention.ms broker configurations (default is 7 days). Messages can also be retained based on their size by setting the log.retention.bytes configuration. Once the retention period or size is reached, the oldest messages are removed from the partition. It's also possible to configure a topic with log compaction, which retains only the latest message for each unique key, effectively compacting the log while preserving the latest state of each key.

**Data Persistence**: Kafka provides strong durability guarantees, ensuring that once a message is written to a partition, it is persisted and will not be lost, even in the case of broker failures. Kafka writes messages to disk and relies on the filesystem cache to cache frequently accessed data in memory. Kafka also uses replication to store multiple copies of each partition across different brokers. The replication factor can be configured on a per-topic basis, and the default value is typically set to 3. This ensures that even if some brokers become unavailable, the data is still accessible from the remaining replicas.

**Message Delivery Semantics**: Kafka provides three message delivery semantics for producers and consumers:

* At-most-once: Messages may be lost, but they are never redelivered.
* At-least-once: Messages are guaranteed to be delivered, but they may be redelivered in case of failures, leading to potential duplicates.
* Exactly-once: Messages are guaranteed to be delivered exactly once, without duplicates. This is achieved by using transactions and idempotent producers in Kafka.

In summary, Kafka messages are flexible in terms of data format and size, and are stored in a distributed, fault-tolerant, and durable manner. Kafka's message retention policies, replication, and delivery semantics ensure that messages are available for consumers even in the face of broker failures or other issues.
