# Data pipeline vs Data lake

ChatSonic:

* A data ingestion pipeline refers to the process of collecting, processing, and transferring data from various sources to a central location for storage and analysis.
  * This pipeline typically involves steps like data extraction, data transformation, and data loading (ETL).
* Data lake is a centralized repository that allows organizations to store all their structured and unstructured data at any scale.
  * Unlike traditional data warehousing, data lakes enable organizations to store raw, unprocessed data that can be used for a variety of purposes, including machine learning and advanced analytics.

In summary, a data ingestion pipeline is mainly a process while a data lake is mainly a storage solution.
